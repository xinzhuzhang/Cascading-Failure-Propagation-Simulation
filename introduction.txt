MATRIX.xlsx is the randomly generated adjacent matrix in the case study (Fig.3).

MATRIX_LENGTH.xlsx shows the length between any two-pair nodes of the, which is randomly generated by MATLAB.
 
TFN.xlsx shows the traffic flow of each node in the case study.

Without_Facility.xlsx shows the simulation results of Figure 4. Sheet 1-6 show the 100 times simulation result with 10 iterations for randomly failed the nodes which belong to the set of node degree 1-6 (k=1-6). Sheet 7 shows the average results of the simulation.

With_Facility_set_k=1.xlsx shows the simulation results of Figure 5, the condition is setting one facility at a randomly node location which belongs to the set of node degree 1(k=1). Sheet 1-6 shows the 100 times simulation results with 10 times iterations for randomly failed the nodes which belong to the set of node degree 1-6 (k=1-6). Sheet 7 shows the average results of the simulation.
